Main obj: learn how to build java apps with springboot and hibernate

we will learn--
dev sb apps, dev rest API using sb, connect hibernate/JPA for database access
dev rest api using sb
create spring mvc app with sb, connect sb app to a database for crud dev, apply spring security to control app access
xml/maven


version: sb3,  spring 6
sb3: require jdk 17 or higher


# springboot embedded server- provide an embedded http server so you can get start quickly
-tomcat jetty..
- no need to install a server separately


code+ tomcat----> add jar file/includes the server--> self contained unit



=> running sb app:
-can be run standalone( included embadded server)
- run from ide/ command line( ex jar jar_file_name.jar)



=> deploying sb app
- can also be deployed in tradition fashion
-deploy warfile to an external server: tomcat, jboss, websphere etc



=> does sb replace spring mvc, springrest etc?
-no sb uses there tech(spring core /rest/mvc/aop ) in background


#sb initializer:
-quick create a starter spring project
-select your dependency
-create a maven/gradle project
-import your project into your ide
-eclipse, intelij, etc


=> maven:
-when we build our java project we may need addi. jar files, ex. spring, hibernate, commons loggings , json etc.
- one approach is to downl. the jar files from each proj. website
- manually add the jar files to your build path/classpath


=> maven provide a nice sollution:
-tell maven the project you are working with dependencies
-spring, hib...
-maven will go out and download the jar files for those projectss 4 u
-and maven will make those jar files available during compile/run
- think or maven as your friendly helper/personal shopper


=> developement process:
1. confi a project at spring init website
2. download the zip file
3. unzip that file
4. import the project into ur ide

=> config project at spring init web
1. open spring initializer website
2. fill/select c1r1--> project: Maven
3. fill/select c1r2--> Language:java
4. select c2r1 --> spring boot: choose the latest released version/ avoid snapshot versions since they are alpha or beta
5. fill project metadata>
 -group....we can set coordinate here ex. / set up the group id/com.abhisb.springboot.demo
  -artifact: actual name of the app/abhisbapp
  -packaging: jar
  - jaca: latest/17
